\section{Hardware and Software setup}

Author used two devices for his investigation :
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Personal computer (PC) with Intel Core i5-7600 processor (Caby Lake architecure) with enabled hyperthreading and enabled SIMD support, 16 GB of HDDR4 HyperX RAM and 128 GB Kingston SSD.
  PC is operated by Windows 10 OS. ChakraCore was compiled with \texttt{mvsc 2017} compiler using both Debug and Release configurations.
