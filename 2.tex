\chapter{WebAssembly Compilers and Engines Overview}

As any other programming language ecosystem, WebAssembly has source-to-WAT or source-to-WASM compilers and IR interpreters (or runtimes).
The most used source languages for WebAssembly are C/C++ and Rust, which are used for development of high-performant applications.
Also JavaScript and TypeScript are popular for compiling to WebAssembly IR or binary code.
This chapter contains short overview of the most efficient tools for WebAssembly compilation and execution.

\section{Compilers}

\subsection{emscripten}

\texttt{emscripten} is the most popular and the most efficient LLVM to Web ahead-of-time compiler and debugger tools.
It supports all languages which could be compiled to LLVM bitcode.

Originally, it had only JavaScript as a compilation target language, but in version \texttt{1.39},
\texttt{emscripten} develpers shipped new \texttt{binaryen} compiler infrastructure as part of \texttt{emscripten} tool.
It allows fast, effective and easy compilation :
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{binaryen} has a single C header, where whole \texttt{C API} is described. This header could be used from JavaScript.
 \item \texttt{binaryen} designed as multicore tools for completely parallen code generation and optimization techniques.
 \item as a rule, \texttt{binaryen} compiler make a lot of compilation passes for better optimization.
   It uses both common and specific compilers optimization techniques as constant folding, loop fusion,
   dead code elimination, experimental escape analysis and target code minification.
 \item \texttt{binaryen} also includes WebAssembly interpreter and separate WebAssmbly IR optimizer. 
\end{itemize}

Nowadays (year 2019) \texttt{emscripten} compiler infrastructure is the most popular among C/C++/Swift developers.

\subsection{Rust WebAssembly target}

Rust compiler infrastructure supports Rust to WAT and Rust to WASM since version \texttt{1.30}.
WAT and WASM are one of the backend output options.
You can add the target by executing \texttt{rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown} in your terminal.
Compilation of Rust program is possible by executing \texttt{cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release}.

Rust optimized compiler has big featureset and it is one of the most efficient compiler nowadays.

\subsection{AssemblyScript}

AssemblyScript is TypeScript-to-WASM compiler was written in TypeScript.
It has its own compiler frontend and uses \texttt{binaryen} as a compiler backend.
